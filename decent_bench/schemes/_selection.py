class FairSelection(ClientSelectionScheme):
    r"""
    Fair client selection inspired by fairness-aware client selection :footcite:p:`Scheme_FairFedCS`.

    The scheme is a simplified count-based fairness rule that prioritizes clients with fewer past selections. It acts
    as a participation-balancing exploration rule: clients selected fewer times are prioritized so that the algorithm
    keeps exploring under-represented clients instead of repeatedly selecting the same ones.
    At round :math:`t`, let :math:`c_i(t)` be the number of previous rounds in which client :math:`i` was selected.
    For the client pool :math:`\mathcal{C}_t` passed to :meth:`select`, the selected set is

    .. math::

        S_t \in \operatorname{arg\,min}_{S \subseteq \mathcal{C}_t,\ |S| = m}
        \sum_{i \in S} c_i(t),

    where :math:`m` is the resolved number of selected clients. Clients with the same count keep the order in which
    they were provided to :meth:`select`. After selecting :math:`S_t`, the counts are updated as

    .. math::

        c_i(t+1) = c_i(t) + \mathbf{1}\{i \in S_t\}.

    Args:
